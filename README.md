# Python Shell Script Template

This is the basis for most of my current shell scripts (as of 2024-09-14 at least!). Feel free to take whatever you
want from [template.py](https://github.com/JonTheNiceGuy/python_shell_script_template/blob/main/template.py) or
review the [blog post](https://jon.sprig.gs/blog/post/8025) which got me here!

I'm under no obligation to fix anything here or maintain this at all! Feel free to reuse any components of this in
your own work without assigning any credit.
